Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Red-Wine-by-R

In this project, I analyzed the Red Wine Dataset and tried to understand which variables are responsible for the quality of the wine. First I tried to get a feel of the variables on their own and then I tried to find out the correlation between them and the Wine Quality with other factors thrown in. Finally I will create a linear model to predict the outcome of a test set data.
- Extensively investigated a tidy dataset on red wine characteristics provided by Udacity. Red Wine dataset was collected by professors from Univ. of Minho in 2009.
- The main objective is to find out which chemical properties influence the quality of Red Wine.
- Visualized variables such as citric acidity and sulphur dioxide levels by using appropriate plots such as scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and box plots. Explored variables using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to identify the most important variables and relationships within the data set.
- Tools & Lib : R prog, ggplot2, corrplot, rmd file, RStudio
